In conclusion, we are confident that we have conducted thorough research into the challenges associated with developing recommendation algorithms, as well as the complexities of implementing them in a multilingual context such as Sri Lanka.

We are also releasing our work under the permissive MIT License, enabling unrestricted usage, modification, and extension by anyone interested. This step aims to enhance accessibility to our research findings and foster collaboration in advancing knowledge and literacy, particularly in our country. Additionally, the availability of our processed data through IPFS further contributes to the accessibility and transparency of our project outcomes.

The data we have gathered has been securely uploaded to an IPFS node, ensuring its accessibility to all users and guaranteeing its longevity through decentralized storage.
