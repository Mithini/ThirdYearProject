The digital age has revolutionized the way we interact with literature, providing unprecedented access to a vast array of books through online platforms. However, despite the convenience of digital bookstores, users often encounter challenges in navigating the plethora of available titles, finding books that match their interests, and ensuring the authenticity of transactions, particularly in the realm of used book sales. Addressing these challenges, our project focuses on the development of a used book sales system powered by blockchain technology. By integrating blockchain, we aim to enhance transparency, security, and trust in the used book marketplace, mitigating concerns related to counterfeit books and fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, by incorporating content-based search algorithms, our system offers personalized recommendations to users, guiding them towards books that align with their tastes and preferences. This report provides a comprehensive overview of our project, detailing the objectives, methodology, design, development, testing, deployment, and future prospects of our innovative solution. Through this endeavor, we seek to revolutionize the used book marketplace, fostering a seamless and trustworthy experience for book enthusiasts worldwide.
