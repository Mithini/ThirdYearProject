Finally, the development of a used book sales system powered by blockchain technology represents an important step forward in addressing the challenges faced by users of the online book market. Our project aims to streamline the process of buying and selling used books, ensuring transparency, security and traceability.
By using content-based search algorithms, the system provides users with personalized recommendations, improving their overall experience and facilitating the discovery of books tailored to their interests and preferences.

Throughout the project, we have meticulously analyzed the existing literature on online book selling platforms, identified the shortcomings of current systems, and proposed innovative solutions to address these challenges. We aim to reduce issues related to counterfeit books and fraudulent transactions, improve transparency and trust in the used book market.
Additionally, by incorporating advanced search algorithms, our system offers personalized recommendations, directing users to books that align with their tastes and preferences.
The development process included requirements analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases, and everything was executed meticulously to ensure the successful implementation of our solution.
