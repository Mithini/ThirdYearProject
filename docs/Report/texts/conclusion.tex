In conclusion, we believe that we have done a solid attempt at researching the difficulties posed by creating recommendation algorithms, and the unique challenges of making it work in a multilingual environment like Sri Lanka.

We are also releasing our work under the permissive MIT License, allowing everyone to use our work freely, extend, modify, use, and abuse it to it's limits, with the hopes that this will improve the knowledge availability and literacy of our country, and the availability of solid research and data on utilizing our native languages in AI/ML contexts.

What data we do have, we have uploaded to a IPFS node, making it freely available for everyone to use, and this data will last throughout our lifetimes and beyond as it is a decentralized repository, similar in nature to LibGen.
