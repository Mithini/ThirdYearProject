During development of this project, we faced many difficulties in implementing the initial scope of our project. The primary and insurmountable hurdle we faced was with data. In our initial proposal, we believed that we could make the recommender model multilingual, and able to understand queries from multiple languages. We primarily focussed on English, Sinhala, and Tamil as our languages of choice, as they are the main three languages of Sri Lanka.

We utilized various datasets to train our models. From datasets pre-made for the purposes of training AI, to data database dumps of popular online libraries, we had no problems finding ready-to-use data for training our recommender in English. The problems arose when we tried to create datasets in Sinhala and Tamil languages.

Towards this end, we requested the assistance of the National Library of Sri Lanka, and obtained their Sri Lanka National Bibliography (Data from January 2000, to June 2022). This is a compedium of 22 years of every book published in Sri Lanka, and the data was available trilingually.
