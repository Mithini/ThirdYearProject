The domain of online bookstores, encompassing both new and used books, constitutes a significant segment of the e-commerce industry. However, the current landscape of online book sales platforms, particularly in the realm of used books, presents several challenges that hinder user experience and trustworthiness. Existing solutions often lack robust mechanisms for facilitating efficient search and discovery processes, resulting in user frustration and suboptimal outcomes. Users encounter difficulties in navigating through the vast array of available titles, and concerns regarding the authenticity and provenance of books persist, casting doubt on the reliability of transactions.

Inadequate search algorithms exacerbate the problem, failing to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences. As a result, users struggle to find relevant titles amidst the extensive catalog, hampering their overall experience. Furthermore, the management of bookstores faces challenges in efficiently handling inventory and ensuring the quality and authenticity of used books.

To address these challenges, our project proposes a comprehensive solution that leverages blockchain technology and advanced search algorithms. By integrating blockchain, we aim to enhance transparency, security, and trust in the used book marketplace. Blockchain ensures immutable records of transactions, mitigating concerns related to counterfeit books and fraudulent activities. Additionally, our solution focuses on improving the performance of search algorithms to provide users with personalized recommendations, facilitating smoother transactions and enhancing user satisfaction.

In summary, our project seeks to revolutionize the way users interact with online bookstores by addressing the inefficiencies and challenges prevalent in the current landscape. By providing a robust and user-friendly platform for buying and selling used books, we aim to foster a seamless and trustworthy experience for both book enthusiasts and bookstore management.Used references are BookSwap.lk and UsedBooks.lk
