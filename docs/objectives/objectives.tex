The primary object is to analyze the feasibility of using blockchain based
technology for storage and management of databases, with a focus on used-books.
The project will also explore the use of AI models for personalized book
recommendations and efficient book searches.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Explore blockchain technology for storage of metadata and transaction data.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Explore blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) and their Existing
                implementations.
          \item Explore possibilities of storing data on-chain and off-chain, and what data
                would suit which form of data storage
          \item Create an open standard for storing book data on a blockchain, and a
                corresponding smart contract for tracking ownership of books.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Explore AI models for personalized book recommendations and efficient book
        searches.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Create an open-source model for book recommendations based on user
                preferences.
          \item Create an open-source model for efficient book searches based on user
                preferences.
          \item Train models to be effective and efficient in processing data in English,
                Tamil and Sinhala.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Create a model user-friendly platform for listing and discovering books for sale or
        exchange.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Implement a web application for users to list and discover books.
          \item Demonstrate the capabilities of the recommendation and search algorithms
          \item Demonstrate the feasibility of storing book data on blockchains, and it's
                benefits over traditional databases.

          \item Create user profiles with transaction history.
          \item Incorporate a messaging system for user interactions.
          \item Explore the feasibility of extending the system to cover public library databases
                through APIs.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
