  Currently, most recommendation/search algorithms are proprietary, and most small
  businesses rely on rudimentary techniques to display data. Customers in Sri Lanka
  find it difficult to navigate e-tailer stores, and find books that they are interested
  in. By creating an open-source model that can easily be integrated by any organzation
  into their storefront, it will allow clients to maximize their revenue and increase
  customer satisfaction.

  Further, if decentralization and federation in the storage of book metadata and transaction
  data is deemed feasible, it will allow for a vast open-source repository of metadata, on
  which any organization can build their own storefronts, and allow for easy exchange of
  data between storefronts, and for aggregation and second-hand market platforms (such as ours)
  to be built on top of it.
