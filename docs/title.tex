    This report presents a detailed development summary of the Advanced Book Search and Recommendations system. The system was created with the aim of providing fast, relevant, and personalized recommendations and search algorithms to all manner of bookstores, libraries, and other facilities. Additionally, the platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of transactions and user data. By incorporating distributed ledger technology, the system provides a transparent and tamper-proof mechanism for tracking book sales and recommendations, enhancing user trust and system reliability. This report details the research, development, testing, and deployment stages of the project.
