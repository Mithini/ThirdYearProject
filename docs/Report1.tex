Our recommendation API will serve two main functions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Receives relevant results (List of best matched books, ranked in order of preference).
    \item User makes requests for recommendations, providing user preference data and receiving similar book suggestions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Search API}

The search API will incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract tags, understand intent, and match tags with relevant results in multiple languages. It will utilize content-based filtering methods to provide accurate and personalized search results.

\subsection{Frontend and Backend Development}

For the frontend, we will primarily use React, employing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack for seamless integration. The backend will be developed using Python, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face for NLP recommendation processes.

\subsubsection{NLP Recommendation Process}

The NLP recommendation process will involve several steps, including:
\begin{itemize}
