\section{Introduction}
The digital age has revolutionized the way we interact with literature, providing unprecedented access to a vast array of books through online platforms. However, despite the convenience of digital bookstores, users often encounter challenges in navigating the plethora of available titles, finding books that match their interests, and ensuring the authenticity of transactions, particularly in the realm of used book sales. Addressing these challenges, our project focuses on the development of a used book sales system powered by blockchain technology. By integrating blockchain, we aim to enhance transparency, security, and trust in the used book marketplace, mitigating concerns related to counterfeit books and fraudulent transactions. Furthermore, by incorporating content-based search algorithms, our system offers personalized recommendations to users, guiding them towards books that align with their tastes and preferences. This report provides a comprehensive overview of our project, detailing the objectives, methodology, design, development, testing, deployment, and future prospects of our innovative solution. Through this endeavor, we seek to revolutionize the used book marketplace, fostering a seamless and trustworthy experience for book enthusiasts worldwide.

\section{Problem statement}
The current landscape of online book sales platforms, particularly in the domain of used books, is plagued by several challenges that hinder user experience and trustworthiness. Existing platforms often lack robust mechanisms for facilitating efficient search and discovery processes, resulting in user frustration and suboptimal outcomes. Furthermore, concerns related to the authenticity and provenance of books persist, raising doubts regarding the reliability of transactions. Inadequate search algorithms fail to provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual user preferences, exacerbating the difficulty of finding relevant titles amidst the vast array of available options. These issues contribute to a lack of confidence among users, inhibiting the growth and potential of the used book marketplace. Addressing these challenges is paramount to unlocking the full potential of online book sales platforms and fostering a more seamless and trustworthy experience for users. Therefore, our project seeks to develop a comprehensive solution that leverages blockchain technology and advanced search algorithms to enhance transparency, security, and user satisfaction in the realm of used book sales. Through this initiative, we aim to revolutionize the way users interact with online bookstores, facilitating smoother transactions, personalized recommendations, and greater trust in the authenticity of books exchanged on the platform.
