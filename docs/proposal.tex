\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Introduction}
This project aims to explore the usage of blockchain based technology in developing
a secure, decentralized, and transparent used book sale exchange solution. The market
currently contains a number of used book sale exchange solutions, but they rely on
individual databases of books, which are often not large enough to be useful to the
end user, and are not updated frequently enough by the owners. The Ethereum blockchain
provides a decentralized solution to this problem, where the books are stored in a
decentralized manner, and the ownership of the books is tracked using smart contracts.
This solution will also be integrated with an AI model that will allow the end user to
discover books that they may be interested in.
