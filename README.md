# Book Recommendation and Search API

## Overview
This project aims to provide a book recommendation and search API along with a demo app. The API utilizes datasets from [Goodbooks-10k-Extended](https://github.com/malcolmosh/goodbooks-10k-extended), Libgen database dumps, and the Sri Lanka National Bibliography. The demo app serves as a frontend for interacting with the API and exploring book recommendations.
