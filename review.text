Review On Existing System


We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the existing used books exchange websites. 
Those websites are aiming to provide a detailed overview of its features, performance, and user experience. 
This review serves as a foundation for our proposal to enhance and optimize the system to meet the evolving needs of our users. 
The mostly existing systems are focused on E-commerce or Cataloging, with limited emphasis on comprehensive bookshop management system.
Common observation of some existing system are User interfaces are vary in terms of simplicity and complexity.
 And Also Integration with book databases and APIs is common for data retrieval and management.
Here are overview of some of the existing website,

    Amazon:
      Amazon is a popular online Web-App that offers both new and used books for sale through third-party sellers. 
      And Users can find a wide selection of used books in various conditions. It offers a vast collection of books, and a user-Friendly interface.
      This system has several sub categories that the books are classified by department, format, author, promotions, prizes, languages etc.
      The user rating and book description part of amazon.com are one of the best features, since it allows user to make an informed decision before purchasing a book.
      Another important feature is a list of alternatives for whether the user wants a brand new or pre-loved (lower cost mentioned) version of books. 
      But the weakness of this website is shipping rates are higher than the ordinary shipment cost. 


    Goodreads: 
	 Goodreads primarily serves as a social platform for readers, it also has a "Giveaways" section where users can enter to win free books.
 	 Additionally, some users may offer books for trade or giveaway in discussion forums.

    AbeBooks:	
	 AbeBooks is a well-established online marketplace for books. 
	 It Include new, used, rare, and out-of-print vary versions of books. 
	 Many independent sellers and bookstores list their inventory on AbeBooks, which means you can find books that may not be available mainstream platforms.
 	 This website Interface is User-Friendly. 
	 Sellers on AbeBooks typically provide detailed descriptions of the book's condition, edition etc. 
	 And They provide international shipping options. This will helps the buyers to make informed decisions.
	 This website consist rare or antique books.They often have first editions and signed copies available.
